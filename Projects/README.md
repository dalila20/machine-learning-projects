The games.csv file was obtained from the following repository: https://github.com/utkarshumang99/Board-Game-Review-Prediction/blob/master/games.csv, since I couldn't find the original repo used in the course (from ThaWeatherman).

The creditcard.csv file was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download
